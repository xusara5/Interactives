            I embedded Apple Music's teaser for Kendrick Lamar's halftime show announcing guest artist SZA. It supports the story by letting the readers see for themselves what the reveal looked like and build excitement. 
            Embedding this video was pretty simple, but I noticed that some videos were restricted by the author (like NFL) to be embedded onto other websites, so I tried to find something that would be easy to view right on the page.

            Curious about where past Super Bowls were held? Take a look at this map to see Super Bowl <a href= "https://www.betfirm.com/super-bowl-host-cities-stadiums/">locations</a> from the past five years.

            I used the Knight Lab Story Maps tool to create a map of the stadiums where the Super Bowl was hosted in the past five years. Clicking through the map is an interactive way for readers to see the past stadiums and where across the country they were hosted.
            The tool was pretty simple to use, but I found that the location search function did not work for any of the stadiums, and I had to use the coordinates to show the place on the map. The coordinate function worked well but it was very specific with syntax. 
            The photos were also a little tricky in terms of sizing; the photos for the last two slides were a too large, but it wasn't clear what the ideal dimensions are.

            Here's a side-by-side of the Kansas City Chiefs post Super Bowl win in 2024 and in 2025 after a stunning loss.

            I used the Knight Lab Juxtapose tool to compare the Chiefs after last year's Super Bowl and after Super Bowl 2025. Allowing readers to slide through to see both pictures is an interactive way for them to see the stark contrast in emotions of the team. 
            The tool itself was really simple to use; it just required pulling links to two photos. One thing I'm strugglling with is dealing with the gap underneath the Juxtapose. I'm not sure if this is due to something built into the iframe or in my code.
